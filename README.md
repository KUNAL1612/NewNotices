# NewNotices
This was originally a "Python script to send toast notifications in Win10 from KGEC website"
But has been modified to display the notification in a GUI window, so as to remove the W10 toast dependency

The site it tracks for new notifications is (kgec.edu.in/notice/Administrative/)

The main project is developed by Kunal Chakrabarty and can be found at (https://github.com/KUNAL1612/NewNotices)
